The AI-Driven Movie Recommendation System is a smart application that suggests personalized movies to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and behavior. Leveraging machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation algorithms, the system analyzes user data to predict and recommend movies users are likely to enjoy. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand movie plots, genres, and user reviews, enhancing the accuracy of recommendations. The system can also integrate real-time feedback (e.g., likes, watch time, or ratings) to continuously improve its suggestions through reinforcement learning or online learning models.
